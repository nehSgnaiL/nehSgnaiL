### Hi there 👋

- I’m exploring research on human mobility — have fun browsing [my site](https://nehsgnail.github.io/)!

- I’m a PhD student at [Mobility Science Lab](https://mobility-science-lab.com), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

- I’m excited to share my curated list of enjoyable research ingredients:

  - [Awesome scientific figure](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/awesome-scientific-figure)

  - [Awesome academic phrase](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/awesome-academic-phrase)

- 😆 Check out the promo repositories for my research papers:

  - [Improving Location Prediction with Inferred Activity](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/LPA)
  - [Predicting Demand in a Coupled Continuous & Network Space](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/GeoTopo-Net)

## 🔧 Setup for Private Profiles

If your GitHub profile is private and you want to generate the snake animation from your contributions:

1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `read:user` scope (or `repo` scope if you want to include contributions from private repositories)
2. Add the token as a repository secret named `GH_PAT`:
   - Go to your repository Settings → Secrets and variables → Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `GH_PAT`
   - Value: Your PAT token
   - ⚠️ **Security Note**: Keep your PAT confidential and never commit it to your repository or share it publicly
3. The workflow will automatically use this token to access your private contribution data

If your profile is public, no additional setup is required - the workflow uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
