### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- Iâ€™m exploring research on human mobility â€” have fun browsing [my site](https://nehsgnail.github.io/)!

- Iâ€™m a PhD student at [Mobility Science Lab](https://mobility-science-lab.com), The Hong Kong Polytechnic University.

- Iâ€™m excited to share my curated list of enjoyable research ingredients:

  - [Awesome scientific figure](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/awesome-scientific-figure)

  - [Awesome academic phrase](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/awesome-academic-phrase)

- ðŸ˜† Check out the promo repositories for my research papers:

  - [Improving Location Prediction with Inferred Activity](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/LPA)
  - [Predicting Demand in a Coupled Continuous & Network Space](https://github.com/nehSgnaiL/GeoTopo-Net)

## ðŸ”§ Setup for Private Profiles

If your GitHub profile is private and you want to generate the snake animation from your contributions:

1. Create a [GitHub Personal Access Token (PAT)](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) with the `read:user` scope
2. Add the token as a repository secret named `GH_PAT`:
   - Go to your repository Settings â†’ Secrets and variables â†’ Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Name: `GH_PAT`
   - Value: Your PAT token
3. The workflow will automatically use this token to access your private contribution data

If your profile is public, no additional setup is required - the workflow uses the default `GITHUB_TOKEN`.
